Upon completion of recruit training, CPL Pratt commenced his Initial Employment Training at the Defence Force School of Signals (DFSS), Macleod. CPL Pratt was trained on basic aspect of the IT industry and once deemed competent; he would then be posted to Army units anywhere in Australia. CPL Pratt’s training does not end at the DFSS, he will continue to gain skill, knowledge and experience through ad-hoc training, field exercises and promotional courses throughout his career.What Kind of work is done by the IT professional?As an IT professional in the ADF, CPL Pratt’s role can vary depending on whether he is in a tactical (field) or strategic environment (base).

The general public?</b><br>CPL Pratt is an IT professional in the Corps of Signals in the Army and therefore, he is seen as a subject matter expert. CPL Pratt deals with various individuals at all levels, from soldiers to high ranking officers. Due to his current posting at DFSS, CPL Pratt deals with trainees on regular basis as well as co-instruct with civilian IT instructors from Box Hill Institute. <br>
CPL Pratt believes that some civilian instructors are often hard to understand by the trainees due to having English as their second language. The civilian instructor also teaches at a level above the understanding of a common trainee and therefore, would sometimes translate information in Army terms. Nevertheless, CPL Pratt maintains good rapport with the Box Hill Institute instructors.Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?When not instructing, CPL Pratt would be in the open plan office and continues to actively pursue knowledge and experience through own personal research and learning, allowing him to maintain situational awareness in regards to new and emerging software and technology.

This is even more difficult to achieve particular when the CoC often does not provide training or just simply no time to conduct continuous training due to high work tempo.<br><br>  <b>What area of IT interest you the most? How will you likely achieve this?</b><br>CPL Pratt expressed high interest in Networking. CPL Pratt believe result is seen immediately if the network is running well or not by the feedback from CoC and clients. CPL Pratt continue to maintain professional development in this area due to the number of free and paid resources available to individuals.CPL Pratt also express particular interest in Server Administration and Cyber Security. CPL Pratt wish to pursue Cyber Security in the near future through tertiary studies.
