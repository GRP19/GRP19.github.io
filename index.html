               There is a mix of different roles between us as a group and the expected day to day work between our different chosen roles. One big connection that we can find is that we have all chosen a role we believe communication and teamwork is a must to allow all of us to succeed professionally. Our chosen roles differ in the fact that some team members are seeking a role that would be considered a top band, whereas the other roles would be considered entry level.

<p>Microsoft Windows #4, Project Management #5, Business Management #7, Customer Service #14.
   These are just some of the I.T specific skills that I will need that are in decent demand by employers.
</p>
<p><b>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</b></p>
<p>Communication Skills #1, Problem Solving #2, Team Work # 4, Planning #7, and Leadership #11. This just names a few general skills that I will definitely need to be able to do for the job of Software Delivery Manager.  </p>
<p><b>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</b></p>
<p>SQL #1, JavaScript #2, Java #3. These are the highest ranked IT specific skills against all of them. Since my ideal job is more of a team/customer relationship job I will most likely only need basic understanding only on these.</p>
<p><b>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</b></p>
<p>Troubleshooting #6, Research #10. These are some of the only general skills that aren’t really a necessity for my job. Since most of the general skills I need to have to be an effective leader.</p>
<p><b>Has your opinion of your ideal job changed?</b></p>
<p>I would say no, my opinion on my ideal job is still relatively unchanged. I like to deal with interpersonal relationships more than coding or developing. Perhaps over time I might slightly change my few but at the moment I’m definitely happy on where I stand on my ideal job scenario.</p>

<p><b>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</b></p>
<p>Currently my only skills that I would feel comfortable stating I have and can use for work would be Graphic Design and Website Production. These skills are not quite as in demand according to Burning Glass as say Java or SQL. As I continue my journey through university and building upon my knowledge, I believe I will most definitely acquire skills attractive to employers</p>
<p><b>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</b></p>
<p>Currently in my position with Apple I have been able to acquire the general skills of Building Relationships, Business Process, and Customer Service among many others. These general skills according to the data sourced from Burning Glass are in high demand from employers.</p>
<p><b>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</b></p>
<p>The three highest ranked IT skills that I have not yet acquired would most likely be Java, SQL, .NET Programming.</p>
<p><b>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</b></p>
<p>The three highest ranked general skills that I have not yet acquired would most likely be Business Management, Business Analysis, and Business Process.</p>
<p><b>Has your opinion of your ideal job changed?</b></p>
<p>My opinion of the ideal role of Frontend Developer has not changed. I believe that currently where I am in life, this role would be a good fit for myself and the skills I further develop and acquire will better me for moving into a different role. </p>

<p><b>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</b></p>
<p>According to the Burning Glass statistics relating to the IT skills demanded by employers, there is indeed a considerable overlap. Technical skills such as Project management, LINUX and Python are all in relatively high demand in Australia (as of March 2018). Project management is the fifth highest at 2252, and LINUX and Python are 1632 and 1150 respectively.</p>
<p><b>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</b></p>
<p>According to the Burning Glass statistics there is also an overlap in general skills required for my desired job. Communication skills are by far the most important with over 44000. Problem solving, analytical skills, management and English rank 16445, 2997 and 2604 respectively. </p>
<p><b>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</b></p>
<p>SQL, JavaScript and JAVA.</p>
<p><b>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</b></p>
<p>Organisational Skills, Writing and team work/collaboration.</p>
<p><b>Has your opinion of your ideal job changed?</b></p>
<p>Not at all. Although it has been very interesting learning about the technical and generalised skills that are currently being demanded by employers.</p>

<p><b>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</b></p>
<p>The IT specific skills match up well. SQL, JavaScript and JAVA are the top three skills in demand and they are also the most in demand for Software engineering. How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?
   Communication, Writing, Organisational Skills, Project Management and Word and Office are the highest general skills. This roughly mirrors the skills that are in greatest demand. With communication skills at number 1 and other than project management which is not listed. Organisational skills is #3 and Writing is #4.

<p><b>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</b></p>
<p>SAP #6, Windows #4, Graphic Design #10 and Technical support #11 are not listed as required although I’m sure basic windows knowledge would be assumed. SAP is software which could readily be learned as a software engineer unlike graphic design and technical support which are specific skill sets that require different training to master.</p>
<p><b>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</b></p>
<p>Teamwork # 5, Troubleshooting #6 and Detail-oriented #8  are not within the top 10 of required and in demand engineering skills.</p>
<p><b>Has your opinion of your ideal job changed?</b></p>
<p>No, Software Engineering is listed as the top occupation by burning data.  Aside from that, researching the industry data has shown me that many IT specific skills are interchangeable between jobs with Hybrid jobs on the rise. Solutions architects which have the highest ranking job in demand have a background in software development and software engineering so software engineering whilst not as high in demand as others is still relatively high and can also lead to higher ranking jobs.</p>

In the tactical environment, CPL Pratt’s role includes but not limited to; provide IT services, System Administrator, monitor Defence Local Area Network, maintain servers and client machines, liaise with clients to resolve issues, roll out upgrades and apply necessary updates.In a strategic environment, CPL Pratt conducts ongoing training to soldiers and officers at his unit, provides technical advice to Chain of Command (CoC) for planning, maintain equipment serviceability, and manage administration of soldiers within his detachments.CPL Pratt is currently posted at DFSS as an Instructor, mentoring and imparting knowledge and experience to young and impressionable trainees. This also include soldiers from other unit that have come to DFSS to complete advance courses.<br><br><b>What kind of people does the IT professional interact with? Are there any other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</b><br>CPL Pratt is an IT professional in the Corps of Signals in the Army and therefore, he is seen as a subject matter expert. CPL Pratt deals with various individuals at all levels, from soldiers to high ranking officers. Due to his current posting at DFSS, CPL Pratt deals with trainees on regular basis as well as co-instruct with civilian IT instructors from Box Hill Institute. <br>
               CPL Pratt believes that some civilian instructors are often hard to understand by the trainees due to having English as their second language. The civilian instructor also teaches at a level above the understanding of a common trainee and therefore, would sometimes translate information in Army terms. Nevertheless, CPL Pratt maintains good rapport with the Box Hill Institute instructors.Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?When not instructing, CPL Pratt would be in the open plan office and continues to actively pursue knowledge and experience through own personal research and learning, allowing him to maintain situational awareness in regards to new and emerging software and technology. When opportunity permits, CPL Pratts conducts additional defence sponsored studies such as Microsoft and Cisco courses online or at an external agency.What aspect of their position is most challenging?CoC expect all Corporal within the Corps of Signals to be subject matter experts at their chosen field however, maintaining the wealth of skills and knowledge gain over the years can be quite a challenge. This is even more difficult to achieve particular when the CoC often does not provide training or just simply no time to conduct continuous training due to high work tempo.<br><br>  <b>What area of IT interest you the most? How will you likely achieve this?</b><br>CPL Pratt expressed high interest in Networking. CPL Pratt believe result is seen immediately if the network is running well or not by the feedback from CoC and clients. CPL Pratt continue to maintain professional development in this area due to the number of free and paid resources available to individuals.CPL Pratt also express particular interest in Server Administration and Cyber Security. CPL Pratt wish to pursue Cyber Security in the near future through tertiary studies.

               <div class = "w3-content w3-text-black" id="Blockchain"><b>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</b></div>
            </h3>
            <br>
            <p>A blockchain is a distributed and immutable ledger that can be adapted to record many 
               different types of transactions, typically these are maintained across several computers that 
               are linked together in a peer-to-peer network using high level cryptography. As the namesake 
               suggests, information is stored together in batches called blocks that are linked 
               chronologically together to form 'chains'. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin utilise blockchain 
               technology to record transactions, and are a form of digital currency that is decentralised and 
               is generated by the solving of complicated mathematical problems by computers. 
            </p>
            <div class ="w3-text-black">There are <b>three main types</b> of blockchains:</div>
            <p>
               <span class ="w3-text-black"><b>1. </b></span>Public (permission-less) blockchains allow anyone to register as a node in the network and 
               each user has a copy of the blockchain. It also allows users to examine a complete history of 
               transaction details. </span><br><br>
               <span class ="w3-text-black"><b>2. </b></span>Private (permissioned) blockchains require consent to be added to the network. Nodes are 
               therefore trusted and there is a higher degree of privacy and control over who can see 
               transaction information. <br><br>
               <span class ="w3-text-black"><b>3. </b></span>Hybrid blockchains utilise the best elements of private and public blockchain solutions, they 
               are flexible in how they can be implements and about which parts of the transactions are 
               visible and private to users. 
            </p>
            Each block contains batches of previous transactions that occurred before it was created and 
            a cryptographic hash of itself and of the block preceding it, thereby verifying the integrity of 
            the chain. Attempts to tamper with the metadata will render the hash on the following block 
            invalid. If a single character or value is altered it completely changes the hash output. One 
            would need to simultaneously modify all of the blocks back to the genesis block in order to 
            tamper with this data.<br>
            The simplified process for determining which transactions comprise the next block are as 
            follows;<br><br>
            <span class ="w3-text-black">1. </span>Client makes a transaction and it's added to the pool of pending transactions.<br>
            <span class ="w3-text-black">2. </span>Nodes detect changes and validate all other transactions that have occurred on the
            blockchain so far are legitimate and unchanged. <br>
            <span class ="w3-text-black">3. </span>'Emulation of a block' and the proof of work algorithm is initiated – nodes on the network 
            work together to solve a cryptographic hash of the block by guessing random values. <br>
            <span class ="w3-text-black">4. </span>Once solved, the block generates a unique hash output and unlocks the position of the next 
            block. It broadcasts to all other nodes on the network and this is used in a proof of stake test to purchase entry into the blockchain.
            <p>
               Using Bitcoin as an example of a public blockchain, whichever node on the network is first to 
               solve the cryptographic puzzle is awarded a single Bitcoin, this process is commonly referred 
               to as 'mining'. With the aggregate computing power of millions of computers worldwide this is 
               estimated to occur once every ten minutes, ensuring a steady supply of Bitcoin is circulating 
               without devaluing the currency. In order to send Bitcoin to another user, the system must first 
               reference previous transactions (or inputs) that demonstrate the account has the sufficient 
               balance to afford the transaction. If the transaction has been used once as an input it is 
               regarded as being used or spent and cannot be used as a future input, other nodes verify this 
               by checking every transaction ever made to confirm it has not been used as an input, and 
               thus this method solves the 'double spend' problem. Some of the state of the art algorithms 
               being utilised by cryptocurrencies include the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm 
               (ECDSA) and mathematical trapdoor functions which help to ensure that funds cannot be 
               accessed by individuals other than the owner. 
            </p>
            <p>The simplified process for authenticating a transaction is as follows (usage of both of the 
               algorithms mentioned above);<br>
               <span class ="w3-text-black">1. </span>Private key creates a public key that other users verify - this process is unidirectional 
               (difficult to find the inverse). And the digital signature (hash) acts as the intermediary.<br>
               <span class ="w3-text-black">2. </span>A digital signature is generated from a combination of both the transaction message and 
               private key.<br>
               <span class ="w3-text-black">3. </span>Other nodes on the network verify that this signature corresponds with the public key, and 
               therefore can verify that it corresponds with the private key, without actually needing to see it. 
               Because the signature is dependent on the transaction message it will be different each time 
               and cannot be reused in a different transaction and cannot be modified/tampered without 
               invalidating the signature. 
            </p>
            <span class ="w3-text-black"><b>Future and potential impact on daily life </b></span>
            <p>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are quite exciting developments and I'm of the perspective 
               that these technologies are still very much in their infancy. There are many instances of these 
               technologies being applied today in the real world, and seemingly limitless possibilities for 
               their utilisation in the coming years. The future will depend on how governments, legislators, 
               businesses and other major players choose to respond and adapt to these imminent shifts in 
               technology. Practically any industry one can think of is scheduled for large scale 
               transformations in regards to the way business is conducted. 
               Financial industry;
               The most obvious sector being the financial industry which is set to be challenged on just 
               about every dimension of how it operates. An example is a service such as transferring 
               money internationally, which is not only lengthy, often taking several days for settlement to 
               resolve, but is also accompanied by a hefty transaction fee. Cryptocurrencies threaten the 
               existence of such a service as it occurs in near real-time, due to payment and settlement 
               occurring in the same step in the process, as well as for a fraction of the transaction price. <br><br>
               <span class ="w3-text-black">Smart contracts;</span><br>
               Various cryptocurrencies have begun implementing smart contracts, a computer protocol 
               which digitally facilitates the negotiation and execution of a contract. The contract can be fine 
               tuned so that the transaction will only occur when the conditions are a perfect match, and the 
               specifications of this procedure are then stored on the blockchain or distributed ledger. This is 
               advantageous as this process can be automated, there are additional levels of security and 
               accuracy, and reduced costs without the need for intermediaries. It stands to reason that both 
               parties involved in the transaction benefit greatly. 
            </p>
            <p><span class ="w3-text-black">Non-fungible tokens (NFT);</span><br>
               Most cryptographic tokens are interchangeable and comprised of parts that are 
               indistinguishable from one another (fungible), however an NFT has the capacity to store 
               unique and far more complicated sets of information. Today NFTs are primarily being utilised 
               as a token on the Ethereum blockchain, but moving forward in time they may prove to be well 
               suited for the storage of different types of sensitive information such as government 
               documentation (driver's licenses, records of immutable land title and assets) and for verifying 
               the legitimacy of tangible goods. <br><br>
               <span class ="w3-text-black">Medical record-keeping;</span><br>
               Blockchain technology can be integrated with pre-existing electronic health records 
               technology for ease of access to up-to-date health information about a particular individual. A 
               private blockchain can be set up to store this information and render it unalterable and only 
               accessible by permitted users. This may also have the added benefit of enhancing individual 
               privacy by removing the centralised host from the equation.<br><br>
               <span class ="w3-text-black">Decentralised cloud storage;<br></span>
               Blockchain can be utilised here to create a decentralised storage hub that isn't owned by any 
               one individual company. This would be particularly effective at bolstering security of 
               information, because a key factor at play relating to data leaks is a large centralised 
               information storage that becomes compromised. Segmenting data in this way would 
               thoroughly alleviate this potential security weakness. It may also serve to enhance privacy 
               and circumvent some of the restrictions imposed by existing cloud services.

            <p>
            <p><b>Introduction - What is Cybersecurity?</b></p>
            <p>Cybersecurity is the practice and techniques of protecting computer systems, networks, mobile devices and electronic systems from malicious intent such as attack, disruption, and data theft.
               What does it do? What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?
               There are three pillars of a complete Cyber Security defence; 
               1. People, 
               2. processes, and 
               3. Technology.
            </P>
            <p>Users must be coherent and adhere to policies and procedures. Organisations must have a documented process which clearly defines roles, responsibilities and procedures. These policies and procedures must be updated regularly. Three main entities must be protected are endpoint devices, routers and cloud (CISCO, What is cybersecurity all about?).
               Cyberthreats are actions that are harmful to IT systems and fall into three categories; 
               Attacks on confidentiality which is a form of electronic ID theft and theft of your financial details. Often these data are sold on the dark web.
               Attacks on integrity is a process of releasing sensitive data into the public for the purpose of destroying or harming an individual or an enterprise’s reputation.
               Attacks on availability is a form of ransom attack that will deny an individual or enterprise access to their own data until financial transaction is made to the attacker.
               Some examples of Cyber Threats that fall in the three main categories are as follows but not limited to; 
               Social Engineering is the use of psychological manipulation of the victim to cohort them to performing actions or giving away information to the attacker.
               Advanced Persistent Threats are unauthorised attacks of a network that remains undetected for a set period of time. 
               Malware are specifically designed software used to gain access or damage IT services without the knowledge of the end user.  Malware are sub-categorise into four major groups (Practical Information Security, p 18, Table 2.1);
               Evader – Removal of evidence and registries as well as termination of Anti-virus, firewalls, and notification of updates.
               Disrupter – Scanning of known-vulnerable services, email sending, 
               Modifier – a malware that modifies or creates new binary. It will also download further malware and hijack browser proxy settings.
               Stealer – Unauthorised extraction of system, user, credential, and or financial data. It will also hijack processes.
               In order to prevent incidents from occurring, there are a number of physical and digital control measures that an enterprise can implement called Goal-based security controls (The Complete Guide to Cybersecurity Risks and Controls, p 110) 
               Preventative Control is to prevent any security incidents from occurring and this includes System hardening, Security awareness and training, Security guards, Change Management, and Account disablement policy.
               Detective Controls is the purpose of detecting incidents once they have occurred. This includes Log monitoring, Trend analysis, Security audit, Video surveillance, and Motion detection.
               Corrective Controls are recovery procedures which include Active IDS, Backups and system recovery.
               Deterrent Controls is to deter any physical incident of IT services which includes Cable locks and Hardware locks.
               Compensating Control are alternate controls in the event the primary control is unserviceable, this includes Multi-Factor authentication, Smart cards, and One-time passwords.
               Common Security Controls are general controls used across the IT systems and includes Contingency planning, Security awareness and training, Incident response, Personnel security and Physical security.
            </p>
            <p>
               What is the likely impact? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?
               Cybercrime is defined by Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission as crimes directed at IT services and crimes that are committed utilising IT services.
               Cybercrime occurs globally with State-sponsored Chinese hackers targeting SE Asia (Ravie Lakshmanan, 2019), the $530 million coincheck hack (Matthew Beedham, 2019), and hackers targeting hospitals in the US (Yessi Bello Perez, 2019). Australia is not immune, costing companies an average of $276,000 between 2014-2015 (Henry Belot, 2016).
            </p>
            <p>
               As the result of increasing and ever growing Cyber Threat activities, there is an increase in demand for Cybersecurity jobs is globally. Some available jobs in Australia are Security software developer, Security architect career path, Security consultant, Information security analyst, Ethical hackers, Computer forensics analysts, Chief information security officer, Penetration tester, IT security consultant, and Security systems administrator (Code Academy, 20 Sep 18).
            </p>
            <p>
               How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?
               Cybersecurity effects every user that connects online. 
               As an individual that has a moderate knowledge of Cybersecurity, I have simple practices that reduce my risk of exposure to an attack when utilising IT services. I am cognisant of what I do online and routinely review the security of my home network.
               Using the three pillars of good Cybersecurity is equally important at home and at work. 
               Using strong passwords, turning computer systems off when not in use, ensuring the security features are present when conducting financial transactions, maintaining software updates, and seek advice if the integrity of a website is in doubt. 
               I believe most of my friends have a good understanding of basic Cybersecurity principles. None of my friends have reported any experiences of Cybersecurity incidents in their personal lives.
               The Australian Signal Directorate has created a website for the public and private sector for awareness and reporting purposes called the Australian Cyber Security Centre. Educating the wider community is an essential part of the national Cybersecurity framework. The more people that understand the basic practices of Cybersecurity, the better it is for our nation’s economic growth and service infrastructures.
            </p>
            <p>
               Conclusion
               It is important to implement security measures in order to prevent or reduces Cyberattacks as the cost of Cyber incidents are rising each year. The consequences of Cyberattack is felt by many and can vary from individuals to a large enterprise.
               Cybercrime is big business.

            <p>
            <p>Machine learning is the task of allowing a computer to follow an algorithm to create an outcome. Machine learning is used in a wide range of uses, such as clerical work, customer service, and fraud detection. Many industries have also started using machine learning to allow for better medical diagnosis and personalised healthcare. Machine learning is an umbrella term for multiple ways computers can be used to produce something from algorithms. In this short time, I will present how machine learning works, the impact machine learning brings, and how machine learning personally impacts me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Machine learning, while not a new technology introduced to the world, it is a form of technology that we are now seeing being used in many different applications across a wide range of industries. From simple mobile phone applications to the use in fraud detection. Machine learning is an umbrella title that encompasses many different ways of allowing computers to perform repetitive tasks and provide outputs. To educate how machine learning works is quite simple. Say you have a job which requires you to say whether or not the face in front of you is of a man called John. Now for a human, you can quickly know if the face is of John or not. However, for a computer, how could it do it? Well, one way could be to find the measurements of John's face. These measurements of Johns face become apart of the data; machine learning would then need other pictures of random people and even more of John to allow the machine learning to decide if the image is of John or not. After seeing all this data, the algorithm should be able to say if the image that is given is of John or not. This is only just one of the ways machine learning is being used to do the work that once a human had to do. Other forms of machine learning are trying to find objects in an image. Google, is one company who is tackling this issue of getting machine learning to figure out what object is in an image. One way they are teaching machine learning to figure out what object is what is by enlisting almost everyone who uses the internet. When signing up for a new user account or submitting a form to a website sometimes you may be asked to find the traffic light in a set of nine images before you can press the submit button.

            <p>Machine learning has already created a significant impact on the world, and everyday people are advancing the abilities of computers performing these complex tasks that would take the human brain a plethora of time to complete. The rise of machine learning will make a more substantial impact and impression on the world, as, without machine learning, the world would not be able to grow and advance in such fields as autonomous driving or even medical diagnosis. However, machine learning also brings the question "Who or what will be replaced?". With the advancement of machine learning, the world has already seen several reports authored stating roles such as clerical work and manufacturing work could be placed on to the chopping board as computers are better at performing those repetitive tasks. However, with the introduction of machine learning, many industries and companies believe that machine learning will introduce more jobs in the market. Companies such as Amazon have pledged to upskill their employees to allow them to become familiar and better suited to work within the machine learning filed. As well as companies pledging to educate their employees, we are now seeing many universities introducing courses focused around machine learning to allow future students to immerse themselves into this dynamic field.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Machine learning already does and will continue to play a significant role in my life. Currently, machine learning is almost featured in the majority of the mobile applications I use on my phone on a daily basis. Those mobile phone applications apply machine learning differently and use their capabilities to perform tasks that would appear not to be aided by machine learning. Most nights I'll unwind after a busy day by watching some TV. However, in this day and age I'm not turning on free to air television, I'm opening one of the many on-demand video streaming services available today. These services invest large amounts of time and money into machine learning to display content to myself which a computer and an algorithm, and a vastness of data about myself, which some of I may not even know, to figure out what I will like to watch. In actions like this, when educated on topics such as machine learning, it is easy to discover that companies have deployed this technology. Now, machine learning is appearing in places where machine learning would seem like such a big introduction for such a small product. For example, I use another mobile phone application to aid my efforts when working out at the gym. Not so long ago, most applications for the active person would try to create a "personalised" workout plan for you. Still, the meaning of personalised did not actually mean tailored down to a tee, but instead slightly adapted after receiving minimal data from the user regarding, weight and height. Now, machine learning has been introduced to process the data given from my Apple Watch or my smart scales to allow for a truly personalised workout plan suited for me made by a machine and an algorithm.Â </p>
            <br>
            <p>Luckily, for myself, I'm am currently studying a field that will easily allow myself to get my foot into the door where machine learning is either developed or used. As machine learning is an emerging technology and what seems like forever branching into different industries and practices, I believe if I were to apply for a job centred around machine learning, I would be able to grow myself with the technology quickly. However, for members of my family and close friends, some of their roles are in danger. My family members and friends, who perform tasks in the customer service industry of assisting customers through the means of Facebook Messenger, their field has seen machine learning applied to reduce the number of working hours needed. The people I know who are lawyers, their roles, while most likely will continue to stick around. The process of how they gather information has vastly changed as machine learning has allowed for the ability of a large number of cases to be understood and presented to help lawyers when in need.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Machine learning is something that has dramatically improved the technology landscape and has improved many industries. It has also allowed for the up-skilling of many people to move them into new roles better suited for a world where machine learning is apart of everyday life.</p>

            <h3>
               <div class = "w3-content w3-text-black" id="Natural Language"><b>Natural Language Processing</b></div>
            </h3>
            <p>
               <span class ="w3-text-black">What is the state of the art of this new technology? </span>
            <p>
               The state-of-the-art part of Natural Language Processing (NLP for short) is that it can read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the numerous languages in a way that is useful. Then, on top of that coupling both NLP and Chatterbots means that the chatterbot can more precisely search for information the user is asking for.
            </p>
            <p>
               Without NLP in Chatterbots, you would be left with a very rough and somewhat useless version of an outdated Chatterbot. Which would not be able to accurately predict with the user is asking for and could end being vastly different then what they were asking for. 
            </p>
            <p>
               <span class ="w3-text-black"> What can be done now using this technology? </span>
            </p>
            <p>
               For example, if you had built a chatterbot and did testing with it, it’s more than likely that it has seen questions asked to it. With some people, they will try to confuse the chatbot and throw it off. Normally, one would try to fix this by adding cookie-cutter responses, yet most of the time these responses can only go so far since it is almost impossible to know which questions will be asked to the bot. 
            </p>
            <p>With NLP, you can train your chatterbot on all types of different interactions that will occur in the future and be able to simplify the responses that the chatterbot gives out. For the most part, training the chatterbot entails being able to feed it an ample number of examples that the chatterbot will encounter. </p>
            <p>One of the best examples with can be done now is with the phone assistants like Siri and Cortana leading the pack. With Siri is was the first phone assistant ever made so of course it came out with bugs and was in what I would call the beta stages of development. But it soon gained traction how it has been useful to a lot of people, many other companies are trying to replicate the success that Apple had with Siri. And with that, they are trying to make sure their customers also receive the same if not better treatment. </p>
            <p>By no means am I saying NLP or Chatterbots are finished and no longer need to be updated, there are still common errors that they still can’t comprehend but with each passing year, the software is getting better. </p>
            <p><span class ="w3-text-black"> What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </span></p>
            <p>One of the things that people are saying that will be coming out soon is the ability of an auditory chatbot being able to translate someone’s native language to another person’s native language. This would be a very big step for A.I, Chatterbots, NLP, and Information Technology as a whole. .</p>
            <p>Another type of A.I Chatterbots that are in the works are digital personal assistants and work bots. 
               These types of digital bots would help streamline the way people work and would be able to keep them on target for the day. When these types of bots end up being released to the public, I’m sure that there will be a boost in productivity within multiple workplaces.
               These are just a couple of new and exciting installments to the chatterbot software. There will be a lot more uses that are still being developed and they can range from Quality of life changes to Massive improvements to our society.
            </p>
            <p><span class ="w3-text-black"> What technological or other developments make this possible? </span></p>
            <p>One of the developments that make this possible is the advancement in multiple areas of AI. Without the advancements of AI, we would not be even close to where we are when it comes to NLP or Chatterbots and definitely not both of them together.</p>
            <p>Another type of technology also helped with being able to improve Chatterbots, and it is the early based social media platforms. With social media platforms is was an easy and convenient way of testing, improving, and tinker with new types of Chatterbots.</p>
            <p><span class ="w3-text-black">What is the potential impact of this development? </span></p>
            <p>The potential impact of Chatterbots combined with Natural Language Processing has already started to impact the world. We can see that right now in businesses around the world with their use of Chatterbots as customer support, this helps customer support since if there was a massive hold up to the talk line it could create restlessness within the customers and no one likes trying to help angry people.</p>
            <p><span class ="w3-text-black">What is likely to change? </span></p>
            <p>Some of the change is going to come from people’s jobs being taken by Chatterbots, Chatterbots with start moving from Customer Service to Customer Experience so the users have an easier way of learning, manipulating, and presenting data for the peers.</p>
            <p> <span class ="w3-text-black">Which people will be most affected and how? </span></p>
            <p>One of the most amounts of affected people will have to be online customers. Online customers will most likely meet an uncountable amount of chatbots through website chatbots and phone chatbots. Some people find these bots annoying and don’t care about them, but the bots are slowly growing in popularity for their usefulness especially with phone Chatbots.</p>
            <p> With phone Chatbots they help direct the customer to the right department without this help it can severely clog a company’s support phone line and can run into the problem of customer dissatisfaction.</p>
            <p><span class ="w3-text-black">Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies? </span></p>
            <p>First off, this will create a need for more code developers from companies that need to create a functioning Chatbot for their needs or improving certain code for the Chatbot to work at its best.</p>
            <p>Chatbots aren’t replacing many jobs as there is still a need for humans to still help customers on a company’s helpline. All the Chatbots do is set up the Support staff to do the best job they can.
               Chatbots also aren’t really making any technology redundant either, as time keeps moving some technologies will be phased out completely since they are better more updated versions, and some do believe that Chatbots are helping technology further improve life for society.
            </p>
            <p><span class ="w3-text-black">In your daily life, how will this affect you? </span></p>
            <p>In my daily life, I use all types of different Chatbots ranging from Phone Assistant Chatbots, Customer Support Chatbots or Website Chatbots. </p>
            <p>These affect how productive my day is, I’ve found it especially helpful with the Phone Assistants. They make sure you know what you have planned today and that you remember when it is. Now for some people they might think that this function is useless but for people that can easily forget or get side-tracked it is a godsend. .</p>
            <p>Also, Website Chatbots have affected me in the past year with how much better they have gotten with reading into what you want giving you the best results that I have been pleasantly surprised but that as well. </p>
            <p> <span class ="w3-text-black">What will be different for you? </span></p>
            <p>As I’ve said above Chatbots have really helped me plan my day out and execute to the best of my abilities. It’s really changed the way I look at all bots in general and hope they can keep on improving this technology to help us even more with day to day jobs. .</p>
            <p>It has also helped me by talking to people who only speak a different language. With Chatbots they have helped by being able to translate their language to mine as vice versa, which has really helped me connect to people I wouldn’t have to be able to otherwise. .</p>
            <p><span class ="w3-text-black"> How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</span></p>
            <p>Again, it has affected my friends and family in similar ways with all the bots I have mentioned. It really changes the structure of how we interact with technology, not only that but also helps in everyday activities. One of the more significant uses for Chatbots was the bot being able to identify what songs fit which occasions when we’re all together and it really helps the mood. .</p>
            <p>With more updates happening to chatbots it will really help everyday lives for everyone in all situations.</p>

            <p>
               To create a website and reference for Australia’s national recycling needs.
            <p>
               The site will use design to represent recycling categories with a simple pictorial system inspired by the recycling symbol itself.
            <p>
               Users will be able to search and quickly identify what is recyclable in their area. Information on category numbers will be displayed underneath a specific design icon that will be used throughout the website and have its own category specific page. The information will be succinct, supported with image examples and themed according to its corresponding icon. 
               We chose this as our team project because it’s relatively simple to implement and will help with Australia’s large recycling problem. 
            </p>
            <p>
               As a country, on average we produce more waste and recycle less than larger developed economies. Just half of our councils nation-wide accept all seven types of plastic, of which only 10 also accept plastic bags.
            </p>
            <p>
               This project is an attempt to garner more public awareness around a growing issue that is relatively well-acknowledged but less understood. With the restrictions on exporting waste having come into effect last year and promised funding by the government this website will be a useful tool to display needed, up-to-date, clear and concise instructions on what can and cannot be recycled in any given area within Australia.
            </p>
            <p> 
               Other possibilities of broader scope can be planned for.
               Partnering with a mapping technology company (Google) could see every charity bin, op-shop, waste disposal centre, community garden and clothing drop off shops (like H&M and ZARA) displayed within a given area and filtered for according to the users search requirements.
               Linking pages can identify common recycling myths, profile waste disposal companies, show statistics and link to products made from recycled materials.
            </p>
            <p>
               However, the main mission will always be to simplify recycling information with good design. Calling back to the icons so that they become synonymous with the materials they represent.
            </p>
            <p><b>TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY</b></p>
            <p>
               The technology needed is not complex and already exists. All that is required is readily available cross-platform software and a server to host the website.
            </p>
            <p> 
               Adobe InDesign and/or photoshop – for the creation of the recycling icons.
               Microsoft office suite – for project documentation, presentations, statistics, budgeting and communicating.
               Adobe Dreamweaver or similar– design the website itself.
               A text editor (terminal, notepad, notepad++ etc.) – writing the code of and testing for the website.
               All website browsers – (chrome, Firefox, safari, internet explorer) – for testing.
               FileZilla – To transfer files onto the website server.
               Slack/WhatsApp/messenger – For the team to communicate with one another and keep tabs on the job itself.
               Coding languages: html5, css3, JavaScript, PHP.
            </p>
            <p><b>SKILLS</b></p>
            <p>
               The ability to use the above software and write in the given code languages. Research, Graphic and website design, copywriting, communications, data collection and analysis. 
            </p>
            <p>
               If successful, the website will be a nationwide tool that coherently displays relevant recycling information to everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
               The ultimate goal for our group is to increase public awareness and education around what individuals and communities can do recycle better and put pressure on companies and governing bodies to have better recycling standards.
